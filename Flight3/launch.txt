LoRa SSDV and 4FSK Backup Latex Balloon - Xday XXth, Xam BST - Northamptonshire

Hi

I hope to release a PITS style balloon on the morning of Xday (XXth) around Xam from Northamptonshire.

It will be transmitting:
	Main LoRa Downlink - 434.712 Mode 1, 1 telemetry packet every 11 image packets
	Backup 4fsk - 

It is a 500g Hwoyee Latex balloon (which actually weighs about 550g) with (100g main + 25g backup + 25g parachute etc) = 150g payload. At 5m/s ascent rate it needs 0.62kg neck lift, expecting a 33.5km burst after 110min from 1,000 Litres of Hydrogen.  (Calculated here:  http://www.randomengineering.co.uk/Random_Aerospace/Balloons.html)

Descent under a 18" SpheraChute at a mass of say 250g, expected at 5.0 m/s (balloon mass left attached could of course be a fair bit higher... (Calculated here: http://www.randomengineering.co.uk/Random_Aerospace/Parachutes.html)
